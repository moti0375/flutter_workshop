/**

 *  In the previous exercises we used Flutter Navigator to navigate between screens in the app.
    When did so, we created as-hoc routes and used the push()method for navigation.

    However, in a real world app, this solution may cause us code duplications and add boilerplate code anywhere we want to navigate.

    In addition, we might want to navigate to a destination screen from a few sources, this, again, will cause us to have code duplication and therefore our app will become harder to maintain.

    It will be much more efficient if we can define all routes in one place and then use them anywhere in our code, in a much more easy way.

    Flutter offers a rich in-app navigation solutions, including Navigator 2.0 which has already been introduced.


    Nevertheless, for this tutorial app, we can use the named routes api.
