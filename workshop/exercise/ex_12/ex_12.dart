/**
 * Theme and Dark Mode
 *
 * Flutter has a built in Themeing framework which allows us to style our app it a modular way!
 * In addition, it also has support for Dark mode.
 *
 * In this chapter we will set our app theme both for light and dark mode
 * and set buttons default shape and corners and text default size across the app
