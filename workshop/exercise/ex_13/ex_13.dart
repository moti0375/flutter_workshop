/**
 *
 *  State Management with MobX and Provider
 *  State management is one of the most important and interesting topic in Flutter
 *  In Flutter there are many ways to managing the state of the app. The most simple way is setState, which we
 *  already used in the HomeScreen and the GalleryScreen.
 *
 *  However, there are many and better ways rather setState.
 *  In this lesson, we will use the MobX + Provider libraries to manage the state of the GalleryScreen.
 *
 *  As mentioned, in Flutter, there are many State Management techniques such as BLoC, Provider, MobX, setState and more.
 *  Each one has its benefits and cons. As you get experienced with Flutter, you will have the knowledge to decide which
 *  is the best for your use case.
 *
 *  For this app, I've chosen MobX + Provider which are quite simple to implement and understand.
